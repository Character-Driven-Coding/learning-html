# Adding Headings, Paragraphs, and Line Breaks

In this section, we will learn how to use headings, paragraphs, and line breaks to structure and format the content of a webpage using HTML.

## Headings

Headings are used to define the hierarchical structure of a document. HTML provides six levels of headings, ranging from `<h1>` to `<h6>`. The `<h1>` heading represents the highest level, while `<h6>` represents the lowest level.

To add a heading to your webpage, simply use the appropriate heading tag. Here's an example:

```html
<h1>This is a Level 1 Heading</h1>
<h2>This is a Level 2 Heading</h2>
<h3>This is a Level 3 Heading</h3>
```

In this example, we have used `<h1>` for the main heading, `<h2>` for a subheading, and `<h3>` for another subheading. You can continue using the remaining heading tags `<h4>`, `<h5>`, and `<h6>` to create further subheadings if needed.

## Paragraphs

Paragraphs are used to group and present blocks of text. To create a paragraph in HTML, use the `<p>` tag. Here's an example:

```html
<p>This is the first paragraph.</p>
<p>This is the second paragraph.</p>
```

In this example, we have created two paragraphs using the `<p>` tag. Each paragraph will be displayed as a separate block of text.

## Line Breaks

Line breaks are used to insert a new line within a paragraph or other inline elements. In HTML, you can use the `<br>` tag to add a line break. Here's an example:

```html
<p>This is the first line.<br>
This is the second line.</p>
```

In this example, the text "This is the first line." will be followed by a line break, and then the text "This is the second line." will appear on a new line.

It's important to note that the `<br>` tag does not require a closing tag, as it is a self-closing tag.

## Summary

Headings, paragraphs, and line breaks are essential elements for structuring and formatting the content of a webpage. Headings provide hierarchy and structure to your document, while paragraphs group and present blocks of text. Line breaks help in creating new lines within paragraphs or other inline elements.
